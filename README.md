# amazon-nitro-tech-data-scraping

This script is used to retrieve data about a particular product (Nitrotech Whey Protein) from amazon.com. The script then saves the result in an external csv file. Results include title, weight, and price.

Multiple python modules are used, such as selenuim to get the page source and beautifulsoup to parse the scraped data.
